This program requests the cashier to enter the amount of currency recieved for the items after providing a customer a total. 
Then, the Cashier enter the cost of the total purchase. The program compare the two inputs(total of purchase vs total of currency provided). If the amount of currency from customer is less than total purchase, the program request additional tender. If the amount of the currency is great than total purchase, the program calculates the amount of currency due back to the customer.
